# Baltimore Mural Data Project

Stand-alone project showing a few D3 data presentation graphs on a single page AngularJS web app.

### Setup
#### Ubuntu or Mac
First git clone the project
```sh
$ cd directoryofproject/
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
Now you should be able to visit the web app locally on port 8000, or another port if you already have a local app running on that port.
Go into browser and enter 127.0.0.1:8000 or localhost:8000

##### or with node package manager
```sh
$ npm install http-server -g
$ cd directoryofproject/
$ http-server -o
```
The -o option will automatically open the project in a tab of your web browser on port 8080
